<h2>2.4.11 Focus Visible Enhanced</h2>
<blockquote><p>When a User Interface Component displays a visible keyboard 
focus, all of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum area: The focus indication area
is greater than or equal to the longest side of the bounding rectangle of the focused control, times 2 CSS pixels.</li>
<li>Focus contrast: Color changes used to indicate focus have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with the colors changed from the unfocused control.</li>
<li>Contrast or thickness: The focus indication area has a 3:1 contrast ratio against all adjacent colors for the minimum area or greater, or has a thickness

<h2>Inclusive Design Principles</h2>
*** Image of three baloons.
<blockquote>It's about designing for the needs of people with permanent, temporary, situational,
or changing disabilities — all of us really</blockquote>

<p><a href="<https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org">inclusivedesignprinciples.org</a></p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Provide comparable experience</h2>
<blockquote>Ensure your interface provides a comparable experience for all so people can accomplish tasks in a way that suits their needs without undermining the quality
of the content.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slides">
<h2>Content for alternatives</h2>
<blockquote>Having a basic alternative, whether it's alt text, a transcript, audio description, or sign language, makes the content accessible
but to be equivalent it needs to capture the essence of the original.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Ergonomic features</h2>
<blockquote>Providing synchronized closed captions makes your video accessible. But making them customizable, color coded, and repositionable
provides a more comparable experience.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Consider situation</h2>
<blockquote>People use your interface in different situations. Make sure your interface delivers a valuable experience to people regardless of their circumstances.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Context sensitive help</h2>
<blockquote>Users may need help when they first encounter a complex form or interaction. This help may become redundant, even distracting,
as a user becomes more familiar with the form or interaction.</blockquote>
</section> 

<section class="slide">
<h2>Captions on the go</h2>
<blockquote>You're aware that the video content you are providing will be consumed on mobile devices, which may be in public spaces where people
might prefer to consume the content without being antisocial. For smaller viewports, sound is switched off and captions activated by default.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Be consistent</h2>
<blockquote>Use familiar conventions and apply them consistently.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Consistent design patterns</h2>
<blockquote>Use consistent web and platform design patterns to help build familiarity and understanding.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Consistent editorial</h2>
<blockquote>Use plain language consistently across platforms including editorial that is relied on by screen reader users such as text alternatives,
headings, labels for buttons and so on.</blockquote>
</section> 

<section class="slide">
<h2>Give control</h2>
<blockquote>Ensure people are in control. People should be able to access and interact with content in their preferred way.</blockquote>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2>Scrolling control</h2>
<blockquote>'Infinite scrolling' can be problematic, especially for users navigating by keyboard because they can't get past the stream of refreshing
content. Give the option to turn off this feature and replace it with a 'load more' button.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Make it stop</h2>
<blockquote>Some users find that animations or parallax scrolling cause nausea, and others find them plain distracting. Where they play automatically,
they should at least be easy to stop, by providing prominent playback controls.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Offer choice</h2>
<blockquote>Consider providing different ways for people to complete tasks, especially those that are complex or non standard.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Accessible alternatives</h2>
<blockquote>Alternative ways of presenting data, such as data tables for info graphics, should be available to all users as an option rather
than a hidden link just for screen reader users. Accessible alternatives can benefit not just a specific target group but all users as long as we offer
the choice.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Prioritise content</h2>
<blockquote>Help users focus on core tasks, features, and information by prioritising them within the content and layout.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Keep task focused</h2>
<blockquote>Progressively reveal features and content when needed, not all in one go.</blockquote>
</section>


<section class="slide">
<h2>Prioritising tasks</h2>
<blockquote>An email application is principally for writing and reading email. The "compose" button is, therefore, present on all screens, and early in the focus order.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Add value</h2>
<blockquote>Consider the value of features and how they improve the experience for different users.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Integration with connected devices</h2>
<blockquote>Using voice interfaces to control multimedia, search for content, output from music or TV adds value
for people who struggle to use other interfaces.</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Integration with platform APIs</h2>
<blockquote>Enhance functionality using platform features. The vibration API makes notifications more usable by deaf and hard of
hearing people while the geolocation API makes it easier for people with mobility impairments to use location based services.</blockquote>
